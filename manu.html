            <h1><b>The Little Kid From Madeira!</b></h1>
            <p1><i>The boy Ronaldo, with his bushy hair and awkward smile, could only have dreamed of being a Ballon d'Or-winner then - a feat he has achieved five times so far.

                But it set the tone for the man who would go on to become a legend for Manchester United, Real Madrid, and his country.</i></p1><br>
                <p2><i>Before Sir Alex Ferguson stumbled upon the forward's talents, the Madeira-born kid was just another youngster with aspirations of making it in the game.

                    Aged just seven, he began playing for his local club - Club Futebol Andorinha, before he tried his luck with Club Desportivo National.</i></p2><br>

                        Manchester United were labouring against Bolton in their league season opener, leading 1-0 after an hour, when Ronaldo replaced Nicky Butt. Aged 18, with blond streaks in his hair that hinted at a certain confidence, the wonderkid had arrived from Portuguese side Sporting for £12.5m days earlier, taking the No.7 shirt vacated by David Beckham. The crowd greeted CR7’s introduction so loudly, and with such elation, that you wondered whether the new boy could possibly match their sky-high expectations. In fact, he more than exceeded them.

                    <p5><i>
                        Receiving the ball for the very first time in a red shirt, he skipped past Nicky Hunt before being upended. “With one of his first touches, I put him on the deck,” the full-back proudly proclaimed years afterwards.<br>
                        “The right-back rattled him straight away,” Alex Ferguson later wrote. “But Cristiano got back up and demanded another pass, right away. I thought, ‘He’s got the balls’.”

Not only did he have the balls, he frequently had the ball in the final half-hour, becoming United’s go-to man as it became obvious how devastatingly effective he could be. “He did about 100 stepovers and earned a penalty,” Kevin Davies later told FFT.

Playing on the left wing, first Ronaldo got his own back on Hunt with a Cruyff turn, then performed some mesmerising stepovers to surge past the defender. 

He was causing such mayhem that just 10 minutes after his entrance, uncertainty in the Trotters’ penalty area led to the starlet being hauled down by Kevin Nolan.<br>

                        <p6><i>
                            Cristiano Ronaldo, as expected, won the coveted Ballon d'Or awarded to the European Footballer of the Year today, becoming the fourth Manchester United player to take the honour and the first since fellow winger George Best in 1968. The Portuguese winger's brilliant scoring form helped him finish ahead of the Barcelona forward Lionel Messi into second place, while the Liverpool striker Fernando Torres was third in the poll results announced overnight by France Football magazine. "It's one of the greatest days of my life. Winning this trophy ... I dreamed about it as a kid," France Football quoted Ronaldo as saying. "Those who know me, who live with me, know that this is finally a dream come true for me." Ronaldo dominated the voting, tallying 446 points. Messi had 281 points and Torres had 179. That gave Ronaldo two points more than AC Milan's Brazilian schemer Kaka tallied to win last year's award. "I am only 23 and it's magnificent. Unbelievable. It's even better considering all the big names in contention this year," Ronaldo said. "Lionel Messi is second and Fernando Torres is third, but also Xavi (Hernandez, in fifth place)."<br>
                            . Ronaldo scored 42 goals in all competitions last season as United won the Barclays Premier League and Champions League trophies.<br>

                        <p7><i>
                            As it would occur, the Stretford end star was not to stay at United for the entire of his career so at the summer transfer of 2009, Cristiano Ronaldo showed interest of leaving the club in quest for new adventure and such for new challanges. Real Madrid were the greatest bidders and Manchester United accepted the 80 million making him the most expensive transfer of his time joining the Santiago Bernabue where he would go and end up scoring 450 goals and more than 220 club assists for the Laliga stars.<br>
                            Cristiano Ronaldo's switch from Man United to Real Madrid will go down as one of the most successful in history and the Portuguese lifted the lid on why he decided to leave Manchester at the time.

"I just thought in my mind I want to go there to show my level, to show that I'm a different player and that's what I did. I arrived and I had a fantastic first season and then I have improved every season," Ronaldo told Nike Football's YouTube channel.<br>

                            "Of course, I'm happy to score the goals, I won't deny that, but the most important thing is the team. they played consistently, they played at a high level and most of the time, we showed a mature intelligence so I'm proud of that."

The sense of a genuine homecoming was reinforced by the man himself, too, as he said: "Everyone knows that the football here in England is different than any part of the world. I've played everywhere and to be honest, England is the most special one.

"I belong to Man Utd. I arrived here at 18 years old, they treated me unbelievable and this is why I came back. I'm so proud to be here and I want to win."
